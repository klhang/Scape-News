# Scape News

Scape News is a real Time News Scraping and Filtering System. I implemented a data pipeline which monitors, scrapes and dedupes latest news. I also built a single-page web application for users to browse news. Finally I Refactored and improved the system by decoupling news scaping components using RabbitMQ.
